# Day 06: [Probably a Fire Hazard](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/6)

Now we finally get to use my [Space2d class](./../space/). Having worked on this over multiple Advent of Codes, it is my general purpose Grid class. It will accumulate more and more features as more problems require them. Hopefully by the end of every Advent of Code it is complete with every feature I could want.

Once you have a grid class and a point class this problem is very straightforward. Read the instructions and act on the grid for every instruction.
