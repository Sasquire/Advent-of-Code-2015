# Day 07: [Some Assembly Required](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/7)

It seems there is always a plethora or "wires" problems and I always manage to make a hacky solution. I should create a standard "wires" library to handle all of the wires problems that arise. The problem might be solved quicker by finding dependencies and working backwards but a brute force approach works well enough.
