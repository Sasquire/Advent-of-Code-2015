Here's where I have cataloged all of my AoC 2015 problems

All code I have written is licensed under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/). For the compiled binary I am obligated to include the licenses of other's work which can be found [here](./pkg/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.toml) amongst the compiled WASM.
