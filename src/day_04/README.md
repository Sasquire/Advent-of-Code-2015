# Day 04: [The Ideal Stocking Stuffer](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/4)

This problem is not too complex. I have no desire to write my own md5 function from scratch so I am using the [md5 crate](https://crates.io/crates/md-5). Once you have a md5 function the problem is fairly simple. The hardest issue was not in rust at all. If you're viewing this on my website, the code will run in a separate thread with Web Workers. That was a hard task.
